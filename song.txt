No more barricades,
The bridge is open,
No more barricades,
The chain is broken.

Mother Russia has given birth,
Bells will ring around the Earth,
Red Square will encircle me,
We're the future of democracy!

Melt the guns and look ahead,
We've passed the test of time,
And this is what our voices say,
And this is what I feel inside...
